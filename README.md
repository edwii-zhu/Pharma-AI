## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui Components
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini AI API
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.local.example`)
4. Run development server with `npm run dev`
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## AI Integration

### How We Use AI

This system leverages Google's Gemini AI models to enhance pharmacy operations in several key ways:

1. **Prescription Processing**: The system uses Gemini's vision capabilities to scan and extract information from prescription images, automatically populating prescription forms and reducing manual data entry errors.

2. **Drug Interaction Analysis**: When prescriptions are processed, Gemini analyzes potential drug-drug interactions, contraindications based on patient medical conditions, age-related concerns, and allergy-related issues.

3. **Inventory Optimization**: The analytics module uses Gemini to generate actionable recommendations for inventory management based on current stock levels, sales patterns, and other factors.

4. **Predictive Analytics**: AI models help forecast inventory needs, identify patterns in prescription volume, and predict potential supply chain issues.

### Why AI

AI integration in our pharmacy system offers several significant benefits:

1. **Error Reduction**: Automated prescription processing and verification reduces human error in medication dispensing.

2. **Time Efficiency**: AI-powered automation streamlines workflows, allowing pharmacy staff to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.

3. **Enhanced Safety**: Proactive identification of potential drug interactions and contraindications improves patient safety.

4. **Cost Optimization**: AI-driven inventory forecasting prevents overstocking and understocking, optimizing inventory costs.

5. **Decision Support**: AI recommendations provide pharmacists with data-driven insights to make better clinical and business decisions.

6. **Scalability**: The system can handle increasing workloads without proportional increases in staffing needs.

### Looking into the future

1. **Fine Tuning LLM**: Tuning an LLM to search specifically for medical studies can make it even more accurate and up to date than the best doctors.

2. **Data Protection**: Extensive encryption to store sensitive patient data.

3. **Custom Image Recognition**: Training a custom Image Recognition software with handwriting samples can allow the software to be even more accurate at reading unclear handwriting.

4. **Integration with existing Tools**: Making AI features accessible to pharmacies still stuck on older software.
